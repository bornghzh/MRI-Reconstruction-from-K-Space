# MRI-Reconstruction-from-K-Space
A Python-based project on MRI Reconstruction from K-Space, featuring a detailed report (unfortunately in Persian - written in LaTeX) with information on K-space and FFT. The project includes various filters for denoising MRI images and evaluates their effectiveness.
