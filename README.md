# MRI-Reconstruction-from-K-Space
A Python-based project on MRI Reconstruction from K-Space, featuring a detailed report (unfortunately in Persian - written in LaTeX) with information on K-space and FFT. The project includes various filters for denoising MRI images and evaluates their effectiveness. 
In this project I,ve used some filter for MRI Image:
- Mean Filter
- Median Filter
- Gaussian Filter
- NLM filter
and calculate SNR & PSNR For them to find which one is the best.
